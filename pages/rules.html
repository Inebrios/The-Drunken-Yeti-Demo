									If you ever have any problems, please provide screenshots, as it makes judging things far, far easier. If possible though, please try to resolve your issues between

							</li>
						<li class="list-group-item listText">3. No pillar/foundation spamming. You CAN claim land, but only the land that you need and will use. Don't hog all of
								the land! Pillars or foundations that are abandoned for more than 2 days will be demo'd.

						<li class="list-group-item listText">4. If you need to block spawns inside your base, you are free to put pillars and foundations to block spawns, but only

							</li>
						<li class="list-group-item listText">5. No building on/blocking rich resource areas.
							</li>
						<li class="list-group-item listText">6. On abberation, you are allowed to build near the public Transmitter (found at 34.9/50.1), but you may not block access
								to the Transmitter. Any bases blocking access will be demo'd to re-allow access.
							</li>
						<li class="list-group-item listText">7. Permanent Bases are NOT allowed to be built on Viking Bay on the beach. It's okay to build there while starting off, but
								once you are capable of moving, you should move to allow places for new folk to start, and then eventually move out. Please refer to this image on where the building 
								is not allowed <br><br>

					<ul class="list-group">
						<li class="list-group-item listText">1. Absolutely NO Flyers or outside dinos from Rag in Aberration! If they are not aberrant or from Aberration 
							(Rock Drakes, Karkinos, Reapers, Light Pets, Ravagers), they are not allowed. Any dinos found breaking this rule can and will be killed on sight.
								(Aberration Dinos are OK to take back and forward, if they are Aberrant or originate from Aberration.)
							</li>
						<li class="list-group-item listText">2. No camping around drops. Make sure that others can get to them. Absolutely no building on/around the deep sea loot crates
								in the Ragnarok desert or the deep ocean.
							</li>
						<li class="list-group-item listText">3. No leaving your dinos on Aggressive!
							</li>
						<li class="list-group-item listText">4. Be sure to EAT the low level Wyvern eggs and Rock Drake Eggs so that better eggs can spawn in. Do NOT drop Wyvern Eggs or 
							Rock Drake Eggs, as they will block ALL spawns near it and prevent any and ALL eggs from spawning within a very large range. If you pick it up, eat it.
							</li>
						<li class="list-group-item listText">5. Make sure to loot all of the items in a beaver dam. If you don't want it, drop it. You can also break dams (if you don't 
							want to pick out all the wood, for example) by attacking them with your dino.
							</li>
						<li class="list-group-item listText">6. No kiting or dropping ANY kind of dinos to or in players' bases.
							</li>
						<li class="list-group-item listText">7. If you demo parts of a base, try to get as much as possible or tell an admin it's location. We can demo it and then you 
							can loot it. 
							</li>
						<li class="list-group-item listText">8. No claiming dinos and leaving them behind where you claimed them. If you claim them, move them as soon as you can to avoid dino clutter.
								If you claim a dino from a demoable base and do not move it by the time an admin comes to demo the base, it will be killed.</li>
